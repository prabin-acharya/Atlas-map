## Atlas

Alas is a realtime collaborative map. Users can make a map more interactive, informative and interesting by adding notes, images, pins, drawing lines and shapes on the map.

You can create a map, add elements to it and invite your friends to plan a trip, trek, survey or just to explore a place.
